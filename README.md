# NextGenVest Front End Challenge

_Visualizing four different types of student loans_

## Installing dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all runtime dependencies, as well as Webpack build and Angular (1).

### Running the app

There are two ways to run the app in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

This will simultaneously bundle webpack and watch the server for any changes (for auto rebuild).


```sh
npm run build-css
```

This will build/compile the CSS based on the SCSS file changes. This will also continuously watch for changes and auto-rebuild.


## Credit

I relied on helpful Angular tutorials (as this is the first time I've learned/used Angular 1 to date) to work through the creation of this code challenge.
